      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pull Requests kicked around and ripped apart, lethal questions barked at a presenter after the &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; slide, the judgmental silence after an ill-placed question. Sometimes I find myself searching for decency in tech. Does it have its place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

such thing as no progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Contributing to Society, Part 1: Money</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been troubling me what constitutes making a contribution to society. Is it going to
work? Is it making art? Is it being a helpful neighbor? Since I&amp;rsquo;m benefiting from a working
society, I sure would want to secure that it keeps thriving, possibly even help elevating it
to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our beloved western societies we are very much &lt;span class=&#34;underline&#34;&gt;goal oriented&lt;/span&gt;. Things are achieved
mostly by communicating goals and commandments, together with a demand of fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since goal-orientation is everywhere it can be a challenge to even notice that it is
constantly going on, and differentiate &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; advice with advice that is actually helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

government discusses spending billions on purchasing and maintaining 30 new nuclear flight
jets (F18F).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Identity and Attention</title>
      <link>https://flyck.github.io/post/attention_identity/</link>

      <guid>https://flyck.github.io/post/attention_identity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identity can be a small thing. I could identify with my home country, my line of work, my
monthly salary or my family name. It could be my hometown, the brand of clothes I wear or a
degree I achieved. Actually, identity &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be a big thing. If that is so, how can the
identity be picked intelligently and how can that choice be undermined by mere attention?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which differences can we find between survival and living in today&amp;rsquo;s world? Which of the two
holds that sweet sweet satisfaction we&amp;rsquo;re longing for? The meaning we attach to &amp;ldquo;survival&amp;rdquo;
needs to be refreshed, as in today&amp;rsquo;s world we have everything we need, while life can seem
dull and repetitive at times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

coming back from a Linux environment I realized this: Windows is not that great of an OS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adults in many ways do have &lt;strong&gt;superpowers&lt;/strong&gt; in the eyes of a child. They have authority. They are
allowed to do many of the things a child cannot do: eat candy whenever they want, stay up
late, drive cars, and schedule their days at their own leisure. Despite these superpowers,
they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; to me as a child. Observing adults faszinated and irritated me, as I&amp;rsquo;m
recalling in this blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I gobbled down two chicken-halves and some mashed potatoes. That was a lot. The other time I was still hungry after a single half, and this time around I was stressing out over barely finishing the meal. I needed to sit down for a bit. I picked a sunny spot. Me being me I took some time to meditate and suddenly I had an epiphany: &amp;ldquo;We are afraid of ourselves, and that is what life is.&amp;quot;. Believe me, this was not the chicken talk, but I had finally figured something out. Let me elaborate…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a couple cute Mormon missionaries came over to me and chatted me up. I estimated the three of them to be roughly my age, probably a couple years younger, around 22 to 23. It was a beautiful, sunny Saturday and I incidentally was sitting on a bench near a church. Later they told me they are specifically roaming these areas to do their work. They started out the conversation talking about their strong belief in god, how they talk to him, and how he would answer them their questions. They proceeded asking me what questions I had for god. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one and couldn&amp;rsquo;t even come up with one, but I was interested in chatting with them, so I invited them to sit down with me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Manifesto: noun. A public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinder could get dirty. Tinder could get tedious. I wrote down my original aims when I started using tinder here, before everything falls into chaos later. Much like with other manifestos ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is pretty important for each of us to be the person we want to be. &lt;em&gt;For survival, for&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;society, for integrity. But what do we know then about who we want to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The three most important skills to have as a young adult</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skill to change your habits&lt;/strong&gt;, so you could start trying new ones (better or worse than your current ones) to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skill to build the desire of trying things truly out of your comfort zone&lt;/strong&gt;, so you could expand your horizon and thereby change more of your habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skill of writing&lt;/strong&gt;, so you could articulate what it is that you want. Also writing can be a great tool for changing your habits.&lt;/li&gt;
