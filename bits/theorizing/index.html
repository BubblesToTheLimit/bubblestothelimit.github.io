<p>You can breathe freely, totally and deeply when your life is not a story. Otherwise you have to hold your breath.</p>

<hr>
<p>&ldquo;From the first to the last breath&rdquo;. This lyric snippet just struck such a cord.</p>
<p>Your life is not a story. This is an illusion!</p>
<p>Dont get caught in your life&rsquo;s story. Breathe! Be alive! Be light! Come up fresh every moment!
&hellip; until the last breath.</p>
<p>#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If we have a certain mastery over / connection with earth, we can freely pick our body climate.</p>
<p>#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Our generation is soo intellectual, so much into thinking, that spirituality becomes weird, esoteric &amp; foreign.</p>
<p>There is simply no relation.</p>
<p>If we were less caught with words &amp; concepts, spirituality would be simply a natural dance to join into.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Life: The ever changing, vs. memory vs. the one who is trying to hold on to both.</p>
<p>#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Most people feel they are struggling too much in order to let go of something heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now&rdquo;, they say. Not now&hellip;</p>
<p>#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Imagine all of the beautiful people who will be born after our death.</p>
<p>#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>You only need to become strong enough to bear your own limitedness, your uglyness and your discomfort with a loving eye.
Then a lot of things can happen in your life.</p>
<p>#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>To love something means somehow to not change it. This way to love yourself, to love life, means to not move at all, but still to change completely.</p>
<p>#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If we stop resisting, we stop being attached. Resistance is attachment. (Image of hand pressing against a wall, thereby effectively being stuck with it)</p>
<p>Once we are no longer attached, we might actually start moving out of it.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>It is good to get out of town and into nature on the weekend, as the town contains a lot of dull colors.
To be again in touch with bright colors lightens you up again and brightens your mood.
#spirituality #theorizing #advice</p>
<hr>
<p>The physical mirror is just a device for the ego, to feed its perversion.
It is not needed for your being itself, as it can easily see itself in others. Actually the quality of you is the quality of what you see.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Consciousness need not take the form of thought.
By going below thought, we can go beyond.
#spirituality #theorizing #thought</p>
<hr>
<p>What is there to fear, when death is certain? How did fear get into your life?</p>
<p>#spirituality #theorizing #mementomori</p>
<hr>
<p>Remember, your ego is just something that your mind is doing while your energy body is on standby.
It is not reality.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Surrender to surrender. Surrender to not surrender. It is the step which cannot be taken. And then surrender that.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>In order for any trickster to fool you, you have to at some level want to believe in his trick.
It is like this with all tricks. If we are honest with ourselfes, the illusion goes.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Most people got some problem with themselves or their lifes. Easy fix: 1) Dont believe the stories people tell you about yourself and move on. 2) Dont look in the mirror too much.
Now I ask you, where is this horrible self that is troubling you? #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;I only believe what I can see&rdquo; - yes! Take that to the extreme.
Just see, dont believe. No words, no concepts.
Let your heart rest on the sweetness of the moment.
#spirituality #theorizing #life</p>
<hr>
<p>Reality is staring us in the face every second, every moment of our lifes.
Dont label things.
#spirituality #theorizing #krishnamurti</p>
<hr>
<p>The predicament of the ego is this: It loves the fight but it suffers the battle.
Surrender. You dont have to carry this.
#spirituality #theorizing #ego #surrender #death #life #mementomori</p>
<hr>
<p>Why worry about something that you can lose? Something that therefor cannot be you at your core?
#spirituality #theorizing #life #death #mementomori</p>
<hr>
<p>What can be serious about life when we know it could be over as soon as tomorrow, next week, the next year, or in 20 years?
When the seriousness goes, a smile could come.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>#Music is very similar to a mechanic of the mind. First a feeling, then a sentence, and a melody which unconsciously leads from one thing to the other.
But its harmonizing and happy as opposed to many a thought.
#spirituality #theorizing #maya</p>
<hr>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever believe (or follow) a thought which came while you where not currently bathing in your own atmosphere (nature).
This is silence, this is bliss.
Otherwise you are just thinking someone elses life.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>To resist and to be attached seem to be 2 different things, but the inability to see this is already induced through that resistance (resistance clutters perception).
To be attached to life is to slightly resist it in every step.
The initial lean-in&hellip;
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>We call ourselves modern and advanced, but we really still live in the dark ages.
This is because only very few people have mystical experiences.
#spirituality #darkage #theorizing #light #mysticism</p>
<hr>
<p>Reasons are unknown to being.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Breathe and look at your limitation without re-entangling
.. that is it.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<p>The simple question &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo; can be one of the greatest doors into self discovery.
Answering this question truthfully is to look at oneself with out agenda, without projections. But this could only be done if we accept death fully &amp; become still.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The ego sees experiences in meditation as achievements, which it tries to reproduce. But it really has a lot do to with just doing nothing, which led to those experiences.
Funnily enough, even doing nothing is seen as a &ldquo;doing&rdquo; by the ego-mind.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The question of the soul is why on earth it is so hard to do #nothing.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>To risk death is to play the ultimate card. It trumps every threat.
People dont respect you if youre not willing to risk something. And to risk nothing is to be a bitch.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Wouldnt you want to notice death, when its happening?
Keep your eyes open.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If you want to give your #life a boost, accept #death with every step.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Ego is a rudamentary tool of enlightenment for the spirit.
No ego is thereby fundamentally of ill will.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>To be proud of a strong ego is to be proud of a strong prison.
No matter its capabilities, its a limitation and is tightly coupled with fear at its core.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When an attack comes, simply say &ldquo;oh death came early&rdquo;, and let it through.
But dont energize it or expect it, dont lean into it. Just let it happen.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Opossed to seriousness, joking allows you to be as you are.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Seriousness essentially tries to evolve by becoming stiff in the undesired parts.
Seriousness is banging your head against your wall.
The joker simply laughs about the parts which hold you back, bringing awareness to that area and transforming.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The energy of the joke is extremely quick. Constantly looking at everything from all angles, immediately coming up with the most intelligent insight. It is wit.
Thereby it is a very potent way of consciousness.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>To take nothing seriously means joking around constantly.
Always go down the most disgusting path, and at the same time turn horror into comedy.
To joke means to #balance.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>There is nothing serious about life. Life is a joke, so you should enjoy it. If you cant enjoy a joke, there is something quite wrong with you.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Lets assume there any many doors on the way to #enlightenment.
Without a commandmend, you might not arrive at the door. Without the key, you might arrive but not know how to pass.
Both together cannot be given in a teaching.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we&rsquo;re trying to find something, everything must be still and silent. Otherwise we might miss it.
But when we&rsquo;re trying to create something, it might get loud.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get trapped in the thought that you will have to meditate for years, working up a ladder.
Doing so could trap you in a new illusion. With enough certainty and direction, rising is a short-term activity.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When a spiritual person is not enlightened, it means clarity and intention never came together.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we neglect &ldquo;our dark side&rdquo;, or simply certain aspects of ourselves, we play while missing certain members of our team.
That team is probably not going to win.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Certain things you cannot see when you&rsquo;re moving fast.
And then moving fast actually becomes dysfunctional.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Dont try to rush through tough times. Without the bad times, there are no good times.
Its like with getting a tattoo. Be still and it will be beautiful.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>When your inner world stops getting tossed around and tumbled from every little thing, the dust could settle and a beautiful flower could slowly grow.
Then you could enjoy the fragrance and stillness of the flower in every moment &amp; situation.
#spirituality #theorizing #observing</p>
<hr>
<p>To know that everything is possible (at every point in time (independent of the situation)), is to be alive.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Character is what we do independent of the situation.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a pain in existance. Dance with it - jive with it, and it will love you.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Reaction is irritation.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>

<p>We tend to stick to those kind of things that we cannot move on from.

<p>Meditation cannot really be on a todo-list. Man in lotus position
Meditation transforms you and thereby burns your todo-list. Meditation on a todo-list is just anxiety.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Thoughts are born out of the #unconscious. To formulate a thought out of a thing, is to interrupt it early, and make it into something thinkable.
If we don&rsquo;t do this, if we keep listening, the momentum continues and can take us to different places.

<p>To be still is to know. DropletMan in lotus position
In movement we become like the arrow Bow and arrow. Practical and fast, but fundamentally unable to change direction - ultimately bound to crash or run our of steam. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>I have understood unconditional love as loving someone independently of their behavior, appearance, etc. But it goes further than that&hellip; it also means to love despite of the circumstance, to love without any evidence. To love in the void.
#theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is asking us if we can be ourselves. #spirituality</p>

<p>Thinking shows disregard for experiencing.

<p>Spiritual teachings are not the teaching. Spirituality is the teaching.

<hr>
<p>When we admit that we know nothing about this existance, we have to smile. And sometimes the physical act of smiling alone means to get over past hurt, and to open up again. A new beginning.. life.. every moment.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we take certain postures inside (and outside), this can only be done when we have made assumptions. Without assumptions we cannot take a posture, because we constantly have to be fresh and engaged with live, to see what is coming.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Especially if you think you know somebody, look again.
Nobody is who they think they are.

<p>When we walk lightly, we walk skillfully.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Above all, humans can ever only show you one side of them at a time.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Even great skills of energy management are not needed when not drawing conclusions. Management has no place in situations of abundance. Just dont draw conclusions!
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When you stop drawing conclusions early your posture changes. Your eyes glow and you walk differently. Your energy changes and women love you, they want to be seen by you.
#spirituality #theorizing #observing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we stop making assumptions, the true nature of things has to reveal itself to us.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When your eyes are not glowing, thats because you are not living. Not because you have a hard live, but because you&rsquo;ve drawn conclusions. Dont draw conclusions about life while it is still going on. They only give you security in suffering. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Reaching early conclusions is a tool of the hurt child, trying to make sense of things and avoid pain. But avoiding pain is not reality, and is not exploring life. Conclusions need to be dropped, so life can be experienced again.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Don&rsquo;t reach conclusions about life, (as long as it&rsquo;s still going on. Just like you wouldnt judge a movie before its over). This way you (can) experience every moment as fresh.

<p>Clarity is easy, you just have to know what you want (with all your heart).

<p>The emptyness of a vessel determines its capacity.

<p>Similar to how Neo eskaped from the matrix, we have to escape from our own feedback loop (good and bad). To act instead of react. Without fear, without limits. Let it rip&hellip; #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing when we lose track of our intention. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When no assumptions are made, (in ones experience) everything can happen. When everything can happen (within ourselves), isnt that we call freedom? #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When everything can happen, that is called freedom. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Not knowing is the start of a miracle. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>It is when we think we know something that we least experience it. Stop making assumptions about what will happen. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>When the moment can do / provide everything for you, there is no more need to worry about past, present and future. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>We want to be free from our burdon, but we flee from the moment. This s non-sensical. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>When we fully respect the moment, we have to admit that the moment could be anything - even death. Or the opening we&rsquo;re hoping for at our very core. In this moment we <em>have</em> to pay attention. Its non-optional. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If a system of pipes is under pressure, this is not due to external factors, but due to a single lever being in a certain setting. If we find &amp; release all our levers, we can immediately live free like a child again. With mastery, we only apply the pressure needed. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>To have forgotten many things should be a big compliment in the seeking community, as certain knowledge is only accessible in certain states. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>If life was a boxing fight, it sure would be good to <em>see</em> the punch while its coming at you. This way you could act more gracefully, instead of starting your action only after beingt hit already. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we look (straight) at life, we must transcend it. When we look away, (when we shy away from it,) we can stay and suffer. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Dont give your own genious such easy tasks all the time. Let it fly, let it rip - let it do its playful dance (in #meditation). #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Saying no to the illusion a thousand times, staying on course&hellip; thats the mission of the heart and the promise of the soul. #spirituality</p>

<p>There never has, and there never will be, a better moment then now. #spirituality #eckharttolle</p>
<hr>
<p>When your device simply replays what it receives, thats what we would call basic technology. If you can play something back that is fundamentally different from what you received, that would be real change. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Anything which you accept, should be yours. Accept the moment. #spirituality #eckharttolle</p>
<hr>
<p>If we&rsquo;re here on earth to experience life, every moment is perfect. #theorizing #spirituality</p>

<p>Being a visionary means being capable of having the dual vision. You can see it like it is, but at the same time you see its highest potential.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Whatever the situation it has to yield to the strongest vision.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Having a strong vision means to never let the uglyness of a situation confuse you about the potential of a situation. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Having a strong #vision means seeing the full potential of something long before its there. It means carrying that inside of you, until it becomes a reality around you.
It means seeing a &ldquo;no&rdquo; 1000 times, keeping your direction, until finally its there.

<p>When they asked the #yogi what he was doing, he answered: everything.

<p>Is science underestimating consciousness? Can (human) consciousness become aware of its own emptyness (at the lowest level)?
#Spiritual seekers say yes. Science says we only have our 5 senses.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is asking us if we can live the lightness that we are at our core, or if we get confused by what we see and just live like everybody else.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>There is nowhere to travel, nowhere to reach, these are ideas of the #ego.
There is only the return to ones self, the return to balance. Yin und Yang Here is where the power lies.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>

<p>When we are ourselves we are our best.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Consciousness only makes sense where there is unconsciousness. These have a yin and yang relationship and couldnt exist without each other. Yin und Yang
Unconsciousness therefor is not the enemy, but just one part of the whole thing.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Doing anything one-sided is not sincere, while it may be useful.
True power lies with those who dare to go beyond usefulness.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The western society believes to have mastered intellectual thinking (the brain is our priority). This is not true. We have mastered making the brain go in very elaborate circles. This is not mastery, this is constipation. Our thoughts are not free. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>#Meditation is like building a castle out of a slightly shittier version of that same castle on that same spot. And it all starts with wondering if you should pick up that shovel. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Only when we forget about work completely during the weekend, can we start fresh on monday. #theorizing #meditation</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes, when we are in a place we have never been before and nobody is with us, it can seem like we are lost and off the right path. But most likely it just means that we have come a long long way and we&rsquo;re still growing. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The physical body is like a motor: The cleaner and purer the energy, the better and more effortlessly it runs. #spirituality #theorizing</p>

<p>India has #yoga. China has #QiGong. Germany has McFit Lächelndes Gesicht mit geöffnetem Mund und lächelnden Augen (fitness studio chain). We travel lightly&hellip; #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Only when we stop making assumptions can we see the uglyness only when its really there, and the beauty in almost everything. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Every moment of our lifes we pick a base tone for our life. Look at this tone. Why did we pick this tone and not bliss? Look at it and you can make a new decision. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Holding on to thoughts creates a narrow mind. So dont hold onto your thoughts, but keep their intention. Intention always finds a way. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Conscious thought starts with an intention set by the heart. The rest is thought triggered by thought - like a perpeto-o-mobile, or thought triggered by sensations in the body. Triggered thought is not conscious thought. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The man setting an intention is the man sitting at an oasis sipping a drink, not the man running to battle wielding his weapon. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is a / the godly tool. It defies all law. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Conscious thought starts with an intention set by the heart. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is the smallest current. It is not the forming of a fist or the tightening of facial muscles. It is the action in non action. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If you become really good at being yourself, one could say you become fully self realized, a beautiful flowering of existance. If youre not, you&rsquo;re a little bit like everybody else, constantly anxious not to be. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Why would you want to light up a dark room? Because you are only a temporary visitor. Just like a sightseeer you would want to see absolutely everything before moving on. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When sleeping is normal, death is surprising. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>If there was no such thing as exhaustion (mental, physical or otherwise), people would simply slave away in the factories, completely disregarding other aspects of life. With exhaustion balance and well-being becomes a major issue. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The greatest game can never be as good as the deepest trueth. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Breathing is our biggest mantra(?) #theorizing #mantra #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Spending time being active with the body is health. While it can seem unproductive besides all the goal achieving, doing #Yoga or #TaiChi is thereby of vital importance. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Why do we give a smile to people who are in a lot of pain? Because we can imagine how it is to be them. For people for which we cannot imagine this we dont give a smile. The ability to see yourself in others creates connection. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The ego is mostly unaware of the mechanisms which run behind its self-inflicted misery. But that&rsquo;s also not its job. Its job is to provide mental sanity and emotional guidance through the mind, in a place where without the heart there&rsquo;s hardly anything to hold on to. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>People with long faces quite obviously live in an illusion. The illusion that something less than the heart is reality. And they feel stuck with it. But the heart never leaves. They always have the choice. #theorizing #hearttalk #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Meditation is SO important to keep a specific balance. Why? A specific quality of going outword (working, making decisions, etc.), cannot be maintained, without a specific quality of going inward. They need equal dedication. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Realization is temporary. As a consequence, some sort of higher state is also something we tend to move on from. Trusting in life, in that which comes next, is a very good idea. Forcing things in this realm is not healthy and also often does not work. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>People give comments about our egos, our personalities, so it may seem like these are what matters. This is just a temporary confusion though and will go away.. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>You could become old and wise, without touching anybody with this wisdom, and then you die. In this context, how high does wisdom need to be on ones life agenda? #spirtuality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to believe that the mind is the only human governance. It is with heart and spirit that we shape our mind, so it can be a useful tool for us. The mind is not where our true identity is and it is not a strong place to establish connection. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Writing is holding on to what the mind does, because that shit is incredible. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Seek the greatest discomfort you and others can offer, and fully enjoy its presence. Stare into the eyes of the devil himself and be aware that without the greatest pain, joy had no meaning. #spirituality #theorizing #yingyang
Also a sure-fire way to return to the present moment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clarity can be strength. If planning ahead and making decisions feels like the constant blarring of a poorly tuned radio, here is how you escape: Connect to the part of you that really just wants to live no matter what. This is a place of clarity, strength and joy. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>There is no need to try and describe that which exceeds the intellect with words. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If you see fear, look her directly into the eyes. She likes that ;) #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>How do you know that you&rsquo;re alive? If you can answer this question with a pleasant feeling inside, you&rsquo;ve made it. #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Clarity is not pleasantness. It is not making a story out of something that is not a story, which can be pleasant. #theorizing</p>
