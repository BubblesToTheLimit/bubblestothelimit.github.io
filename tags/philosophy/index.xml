      <description>&lt;p&gt;Generally the topic of death is largely invisible in our society. Dead people are transported
off of hospitals only during the night, millions are spend on artificial teeth every year and
old people take medication during family gatherings to temporarily overshadow the effect of
&amp;ldquo;old people diseases&amp;rdquo; like Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s. Decay in general pains us and is masked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though we try to avoid death itself and we generally don&amp;rsquo;t wish it on anybody, which
useful things can we draw from considering death?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
