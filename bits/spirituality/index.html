<hr>
<p>When a spiritual person is not enlightened, it means clarity and intention never came together.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we neglect &ldquo;our dark side&rdquo;, or simply certain aspects of ourselves, we play while missing certain members of our team.
That team is probably not going to win.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Certain things you cannot see when you&rsquo;re moving fast.
And then moving fast actually becomes dysfunctional.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Dont try to rush through tough times. Without the bad times, there are no good times.
Its like with getting a tattoo. Be still and it will be beautiful.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>When your inner world stops getting tossed around and tumbled from every little thing, the dust could settle and a beautiful flower could slowly grow.
Then you could enjoy the fragrance and stillness of the flower in every moment &amp; situation.
#spirituality #theorizing #observing</p>
<hr>
<p>To know that everything is possible (at every point in time (independent of the situation)), is to be alive.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Character is what we do independent of the situation.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a pain in existance. Dance with it - jive with it, and it will love you.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Reaction is irritation.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The path of least resistance is the path of no resistance. Folded hands
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>There is no judgement, only entanglement.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>We tend to stick to those kind of things that we cannot move on from.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When you give a boy all he wanted&hellip; and then he realizes it was really everything. Then he will fall in gratitude. Loudly crying faceFolded hands
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Meditation cannot really be on a todo-list. Man in lotus position
Meditation transforms you and thereby burns your todo-list. Meditation on a todo-list is just anxiety.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Thoughts are born out of the #unconscious. To formulate a thought out of a thing, is to interrupt it early, and make it into something thinkable.
If we don&rsquo;t do this, if we keep listening, the momentum continues and can take us to different places.
#spirituality #innermovie</p>
<hr>
<p>To be still is to know. DropletMan in lotus position
In movement we become like the arrow Bow and arrow. Practical and fast, but fundamentally unable to change direction - ultimately bound to crash or run our of steam. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>I have understood unconditional love as loving someone independently of their behavior, appearance, etc. But it goes further than that&hellip; it also means to love despite of the circumstance, to love without any evidence. To love in the void.
#theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is asking us if we can be ourselves. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Thinking shows disregard for experiencing.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Spiritual teachings are not the teaching. Spirituality is the teaching.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>When we admit that we know nothing about this existance, we have to smile. And sometimes the physical act of smiling alone means to get over past hurt, and to open up again. A new beginning.. life.. every moment.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we take certain postures inside (and outside), this can only be done when we have made assumptions. Without assumptions we cannot take a posture, because we constantly have to be fresh and engaged with live, to see what is coming.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Especially if you think you know somebody, look again.
Nobody is who they think they are.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we walk lightly, we walk skillfully.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Above all, humans can ever only show you one side of them at a time.
#spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Even great skills of energy management are not needed when not drawing conclusions. Management has no place in situations of abundance. Just dont draw conclusions!
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When you stop drawing conclusions early your posture changes. Your eyes glow and you walk differently. Your energy changes and women love you, they want to be seen by you.
#spirituality #theorizing #observing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we stop making assumptions, the true nature of things has to reveal itself to us.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When your eyes are not glowing, thats because you are not living. Not because you have a hard live, but because you&rsquo;ve drawn conclusions. Dont draw conclusions about life while it is still going on. They only give you security in suffering. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Reaching early conclusions is a tool of the hurt child, trying to make sense of things and avoid pain. But avoiding pain is not reality, and is not exploring life. Conclusions need to be dropped, so life can be experienced again.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Don&rsquo;t reach conclusions about life, (as long as it&rsquo;s still going on. Just like you wouldnt judge a movie before its over). This way you (can) experience every moment as fresh.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Clarity is easy, you just have to know what you want (with all your heart).
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The emptyness of a vessel determines its capacity.
So don&rsquo;t be too full of yourself.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Similar to how Neo eskaped from the matrix, we have to escape from our own feedback loop (good and bad). To act instead of react. Without fear, without limits. Let it rip&hellip; #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing when we lose track of our intention. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When no assumptions are made, (in ones experience) everything can happen. When everything can happen (within ourselves), isnt that we call freedom? #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When everything can happen, that is called freedom. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Not knowing is the start of a miracle. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>It is when we think we know something that we least experience it. Stop making assumptions about what will happen. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>When the moment can do / provide everything for you, there is no more need to worry about past, present and future. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>We want to be free from our burdon, but we flee from the moment. This s non-sensical. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>When we fully respect the moment, we have to admit that the moment could be anything - even death. Or the opening we&rsquo;re hoping for at our very core. In this moment we <em>have</em> to pay attention. Its non-optional. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If a system of pipes is under pressure, this is not due to external factors, but due to a single lever being in a certain setting. If we find &amp; release all our levers, we can immediately live free like a child again. With mastery, we only apply the pressure needed. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>To have forgotten many things should be a big compliment in the seeking community, as certain knowledge is only accessible in certain states. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>If life was a boxing fight, it sure would be good to <em>see</em> the punch while its coming at you. This way you could act more gracefully, instead of starting your action only after beingt hit already. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we look (straight) at life, we must transcend it. When we look away, (when we shy away from it,) we can stay and suffer. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Dont give your own genious such easy tasks all the time. Let it fly, let it rip - let it do its playful dance (in #meditation). #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Saying no to the illusion a thousand times, staying on course&hellip; thats the mission of the heart and the promise of the soul. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>There never has, and there never will be, a better moment then now. #spirituality #eckharttolle</p>
<hr>
<p>When your device simply replays what it receives, thats what we would call basic technology. If you can play something back that is fundamentally different from what you received, that would be real change. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Anything which you accept, should be yours. Accept the moment. #spirituality #eckharttolle</p>
<hr>
<p>If we&rsquo;re here on earth to experience life, every moment is perfect. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Being a visionary means being capable of having the dual vision. You can see it like it is, but at the same time you see its highest potential.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Whatever the situation it has to yield to the strongest vision.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Having a strong vision means to never let the uglyness of a situation confuse you about the potential of a situation. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Having a strong #vision means seeing the full potential of something long before its there. It means carrying that inside of you, until it becomes a reality around you.
It means seeing a &ldquo;no&rdquo; 1000 times, keeping your direction, until finally its there.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When they asked the #yogi what he was doing, he answered: everything.
#spirituality #meditation</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is a gift if we&rsquo;re willing to unpack it and look inside.
#meditation #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Is science underestimating consciousness? Can (human) consciousness become aware of its own emptyness (at the lowest level)?
#Spiritual seekers say yes. Science says we only have our 5 senses.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is asking us if we can live the lightness that we are at our core, or if we get confused by what we see and just live like everybody else.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Nothing in our environment holds us back. We just live blindly. #nofilter #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>There is nowhere to travel, nowhere to reach, these are ideas of the #ego.
There is only the return to ones self, the return to balance. Yin und Yang Here is where the power lies.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When we are ourselves we are our best.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Consciousness only makes sense where there is unconsciousness. These have a yin and yang relationship and couldnt exist without each other. Yin und Yang
Unconsciousness therefor is not the enemy, but just one part of the whole thing.
#spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Alan Watts once famously said &ldquo;the godhead cannot see itself&rdquo;. Yes, true, but nevertheless: The godhead can <em>be</em> itself.
When you connect with your higher self in #meditation this becomes super important. The active god wouldnt need to look at himself in the mirror. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Doing anything one-sided is not sincere, while it may be useful.
True power lies with those who dare to go beyond usefulness.

<p>The western society believes to have mastered intellectual thinking (the brain is our priority). This is not true. We have mastered making the brain go in very elaborate circles. This is not mastery, this is constipation. Our thoughts are not free. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Once the cyclic pattern of the brain has been lifted, only then youre able to think absolutely freely. But then you better have a good base to stand on. You need direction. Breaking cyclic patterns increases the awareness, required attention and energy for living. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>As a society we&rsquo;re way too excited about our brains. The brain is essentially just moving in circles. The personality just relates everything that happens back to our mostly unconscious persona. And especially discipline is one big cicle. Not that advanced, is it. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>In meditation, find the heavyness. Where is the uglyness, where is the burdon? Sit with it, become aware of it. This leads to more and more #stillness, as your whole system learns that it can take it. Say yes to everything. Stop running. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes, when we are in a place we have never been before and nobody is with us, it can seem like we are lost and off the right path. But most likely it just means that we have come a long long way and we&rsquo;re still growing. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The physical body is like a motor: The cleaner and purer the energy, the better and more effortlessly it runs. #spirituality #theorizing</p>

<p>India has #yoga. China has #QiGong. Germany has McFit Lächelndes Gesicht mit geöffnetem Mund und lächelnden Augen (fitness studio chain). We travel lightly&hellip; #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Wenn wir hier auf Erden die Liebe vollständig in unseren Herzen spüren können, dann ist schon viel getan. #spirituality #german</p>
<hr>
<p>Dont ever estimate the current moment in the background of the previous moment. This diminishes growth. What has not been yesterday can be today. Not as the effect of a cause (#yang), but because we let it into our life (#yin). #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe that all / most souls #incarnated on this earth to encounter the apparent absence of love. Many people experience this absence successfully, but in a way that says: &ldquo;oh no, i found it and it is REAL&rdquo;, i.e. taking the illusion too seriously. Thread #spirituality #thread

<hr>
<p>TV / Youtube teaches us subliminally to pay attention to only one, emotionally charged thing. Life has more dimensions than that. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>At their core, human beings just want to be seen for what they are. So when you decide to drop your assumptions and pay absolute attention, you eyes start glowing and they will pay you back with everything they have: what they are. #lostinthought #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Only when we stop making assumptions can we see the uglyness only when its really there, and the beauty in almost everything. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>If I cant find beauty in this moment, the next moment shall be in vain. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Every moment of our lifes we pick a base tone for our life. Look at this tone. Why did we pick this tone and not bliss? Look at it and you can make a new decision. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Holding on to thoughts creates a narrow mind. So dont hold onto your thoughts, but keep their intention. Intention always finds a way. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Within my heart burns the eternal flame (of life). #spirituality #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The man setting an intention is the man sitting at an oasis sipping a drink, not the man running to battle wielding his weapon. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is a / the godly tool. It defies all law. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is the smallest current. It is not the forming of a fist or the tightening of facial muscles. It is the action in non action. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Skillful living is to have the system like itself. The truth is that the body itself doesnt like being sick or in disease. This only has to be aligned with our liking for the sweet pain of drama and our indecisiveness of wanting to love ourselves or not. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>If you become really good at being yourself, one could say you become fully self realized, a beautiful flowering of existance. If youre not, you&rsquo;re a little bit like everybody else, constantly anxious not to be. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is like a brochure. Only if you&rsquo;re interest you&rsquo;ll get more information. Or you can make some assumptions about it and throw it. #spirituality #mementomori</p>
<hr>
<p>Constantly working for tomorrow is a crime against your life. Because tomorrow never comes. #spirituality #mementomori</p>
<hr>
<p>Every moment can be used for enlightenment. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Why would you want to light up a dark room? Because you are only a temporary visitor. Just like a sightseeer you would want to see absolutely everything before moving on. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>When sleeping is normal, death is surprising. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Life is wonderful. Sleeping may be boring. #meditativeThoughts #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be disappointed in the world, because the world can be enlightened by you. #meditativeThoughts #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Plants require a certain atmosphere to grow. This atmosphere is the same for humans. #spirituality #tantra</p>
<hr>
<p>The man who knows how to sit, breathe and walk knows about the secrets of the universe. #meditativethoughts #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Does your body hold your untouchable, or is it vice versa? When this relationship reverses, when the body no longer has to hold the spirit, it can relax, let go and heal, while now the spirit has the option to bring it to a higher possibility. #spirituality #meditativeThoughts</p>
<hr>
<p>The physical body holds something that is untouchable - in this lies the freedom.
#spirituality #meditativeThoughts</p>
<hr>
<p>What if besides all the illusions it would actually turn out that it mattered how we are within ourselves? Then only #spirituality would flourish - not personally, but socially and globally.</p>
<hr>
<p>Human connection holds a tremendous possibilty, while the intellect is a very sharp tool at best or a blunt one at its worst. Which one do you chose? #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a tremendous possibility in exploring the #spirituality of the #unspiritual! Actually there is no such thing as being non-spiritual, it is just that &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; people keep an effort in keeping it low in themselves and others. This still requires a lot of knowledge!</p>
<hr>
<p>Intention is the smallest building block of creation and thereby also in a sense the only building block of creation and thereby existance. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Everything must align with a strong enough intention. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>I understand gurus now. They let people ask questions, thereby letting them exercise their intent of knowing. The very act of asking brings progress, as practice makes perfect and intent is the power of the universe. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Intent is the power of the universe. #spirituality #intent</p>
<hr>
<p>Intent is another word for life really #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Bitterness cannot happen to you if you have a tool to deal with the world. #spirituality #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>Intent is that all-powerfull weapon / wisdom that can do it all. One does not need to move mountains, only keeping the intent is required. It&rsquo;s the golden rule of the universe and knows no exceptions. #spirituality</p>

<p>The greatest game can never be as good as the deepest trueth. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Breathing is our biggest mantra(?) #theorizing #mantra #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Turns out most thoughts we have are are actually for self-entertainment and not to reach a certain goal. Focusing on the third eye chakra naturally mutes those thoughts, which is huge. It feels like the personality changes. #spirituality #thirdeye</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes you gotta take time to listen to your heart, because that shit is talking, and it would be kind of rude not to. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>People with long faces quite obviously live in an illusion. The illusion that something less than the heart is reality. And they feel stuck with it. But the heart never leaves. They always have the choice. #theorizing #hearttalk #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Meditation is SO important to keep a specific balance. Why? A specific quality of going outword (working, making decisions, etc.), cannot be maintained, without a specific quality of going inward. They need equal dedication. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Realization is temporary. As a consequence, some sort of higher state is also something we tend to move on from. Trusting in life, in that which comes next, is a very good idea. Forcing things in this realm is not healthy and also often does not work. #theorizing #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>People give comments about our egos, our personalities, so it may seem like these are what matters. This is just a temporary confusion though and will go away.. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to believe that the mind is the only human governance. It is with heart and spirit that we shape our mind, so it can be a useful tool for us. The mind is not where our true identity is and it is not a strong place to establish connection. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you you find the strength to gain a victory over your own demons, for that moment you&rsquo;ll be able to connect with others deeply. This is because you are recognizing that which people are hiding from themselves. #spirituality #lostinthought</p>
<hr>
<p>The ultimate defense is pure self-love. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>If you&rsquo;re open to a significant amount of variance, you&rsquo;ll find that you can describe nothing. In a situation of abundance, speech is of no use. #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>At the best places you leave something that came from you and leave with something that is now yours #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Seek the greatest discomfort you and others can offer, and fully enjoy its presence. Stare into the eyes of the devil himself and be aware that without the greatest pain, joy had no meaning. #spirituality #theorizing #yingyang
Also a sure-fire way to return to the present moment.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not excited about each and every moment going forward in terms of the quality of your being, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong. This is a clear indicator that you&rsquo;re not in the moment, and thereby a first step to get back into it. Are you excited about the moment? #spirituality</p>
<hr>
<p>Learning about #spirituality is usually a sweet pain. Learning about deep meditation makes it feel like a burdon having to keep the eyes open. Learning some more about love makes it disheartening to experience under which rare conditions people allow themselves to connect.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is no need to try and describe that which exceeds the intellect with words. #spirituality #theorizing</p>
<hr>
<p>The forest is big. #spirituality</p>
