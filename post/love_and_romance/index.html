        <p>Slowly slipping into my thirties I&rsquo;m talking more to people about marriage and dating. What
is there to say about the underlying issue of love and romance, when time runs out and it&rsquo;s
time to mingle?</p>
<h1 id="the-guy-question-am-i-replaceable">The guy question: Am I replaceable?</h1>
<p>Many guys feel that a whole lot of economic questions are posed to them during dates right
from the getgo, especially as they get closer to the typical marriage age. Do you have a
car? Where was your last vacation? Did you take the train there or did you fly? How big is
your apartment? In which area do you live? What kind of job do you work?</p>
<p>Talking about this with a neighbour, he specifically mentioned girls stop seeing him after
only a couple of dates. This usually happens to coincide with their first visit to his
apartment. He lives in a good area but his place is not too big (37m^2). Most girls didnt
give any reason, but the few that did mostly mentioned his apartment. The furnishing of his
apartment is very good by the way, it is only that with the size, it is definitely sized for
only a single person. Now he just broke up again with a girl he has was dating in total for
9 months. One of the things she held against him, that his small size apartment was
&ldquo;unmasculine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Definitely the type of criticism which can get to your head. Advice from his best friend
didnt help either, who insisted he first needs to &ldquo;build a nest&rdquo;, in order to attract a lasting
partner.</p>
<p>The math definitely checks out. Women are looking to marry at a certain age and the
biological clock ticks. But for many a guy the mostly economical categories women select by
at this point, can seem alienating. Especially once you see them shortly after the breakup
with a new guy, with similar physique, but who was apparently willing to check all the
boxes.</p>
<p>Especially the timeliness in which these new similar guys show up begs the question if real
love was involved. Also, how do you know if your current partner just selected you on those
gross criteria and made a quick deal, just because their time ran out?</p>
<p>This might seem as an overly romantisiced view on the whole issue of dating in your
thirties, but there is also some good rationale to it. A supposedly romantic and loving
relationship, which is mostly based on economic and physical checkboxes, would hardly have
any substance to push through hard times. So it is logical to think how such relationships
could best be avoided.</p>
<p>As my neighbour is now moving out of his apartment to a bigger place, these are exactly the
questions he asks himself, but they are also questions for men in general. How replaceable
am I with all this interrogation about money? Will my woman stand by me if my financial
situation gets worse? How do I find a woman who likes me for me?</p>
<h1 id="the-girl-question-the-opposite-side-of-the-coin">The girl question: The opposite side of the coin</h1>
<p>On the other side, if males are so easily replaceable - just find a nice guy who can pay the
bills - how replaceable are our &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; partners?</p>
<p>I find that many guys, honestly including myself, dont have too many requirements for a
girl. She needs to be pretty, funny, intelligent… that&rsquo;s about it. And there are a whole
lot of woman like this out there.</p>
<p>So if these are the only requirements from most men out there… it would also be easy for
the women to ask the same question: How quick until my ex will find a new mate which checks
all the same boxes?</p>
<p>Again, it is not exactly romantic, to think that your significant other could easily replace
you with an equally fitting partner.</p>
<h1 id="love-and-romance">Love and Romance?</h1>
<p>So in this harsh world, where everybody is replaceable, is this even still about love and
romance? To be easily replaced is definitely not romantic.</p>
<p>This harsh view of the situation somehow gets us nowhere, and could make people bitter or
doubtful. So let&rsquo;s put a different spin on this.</p>
<p>People dont know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Especially in heart matters this is true, and pop culture backs me up here. There are
countless songs telling the story of people not knowing what they are doing with love. Take
only &ldquo;You dont know what love is&rdquo; from the White Stripes, or &ldquo;Was du Liebe nennst&rdquo; (What you
call love) from Bauza, beautifully illustrating my point.</p>
<p>So what is my take?</p>
<p>I find that everybody can be loved. A truly loving and joyful person can love almost
everybody. Just one look into the eyes and.. its hard to resist a smile that comes from the
heart. It is in that moment we can feel love, even with a complete stranger.</p>
<p>So going by that, the truth is that lovers in a way are ultimately infinitely replaceable,
since almost everybody can be loved. In fact, you as a loved person didnt get replaced, it
is just a that the other person now loves and spends time with somebody else. Love is not
exclusive in that way. Relationships are, but love isnt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in my experience every love feels different. Every relationship feels
different, even though it may equally be love. So while a partner moves on to exclusively
only loving a new person, this love will not be the same, will not taste the same, will not
feel the same, as the love you had together.</p>
<p>This is where I would see the romance of love. Not because its exclusive or irreplaceable,
but because it is totally unique.</p>
